# Project Summary

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts through a word frequency analyzer applied to a transcript about AI coding assistants.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created a conversation tracking system to document all prompts and responses
- Established a markdown file in the `prompts` directory for maintaining conversation history

### 2. Hello World Program
- Created a simple Python script (`main.py`) that prints "Hello World"
- Successfully executed the program to verify Python environment setup

### 3. Word Frequency Analyzer
- Developed a Python script that:
  - Reads the `transcript.txt` file containing a discussion about OpenAI's Real-Time API
  - Counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary data structure
  - Removes common punctuation from words
  - Sorts words by frequency in descending order
  - Displays results in a readable format

### 4. Enhanced Analysis Features
- Added total word count display (2,806 words in the transcript)
- Implemented filtering to show only words appearing more than 5 times
- Reduced output from all words to 95 most frequent words

## Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated
- File I/O operations in Python
- Dictionary usage for counting and storing data
- String manipulation and cleaning
- Sorting algorithms (using lambda functions)
- Control flow with conditionals

## Files Created/Modified
- `main.py` - The main Python script for word frequency analysis
- `prompts/conversation-tracking.md` - Documentation of all interactions
- `summary.md` - This summary file

## Results
The analysis revealed the most common words in the AI coding transcript:
- "and" (129 occurrences)
- "the" (112 occurrences)
- "to" (90 occurrences)
- And 92 other frequently used words
