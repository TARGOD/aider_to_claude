Hello everyone, welcome to today's meeting. We are here to discuss the quarterly results and future planning for our company. 

First, let me talk about our sales performance. This quarter we achieved a growth of 25% compared to the previous quarter. The team has worked really hard to achieve these numbers.

Now, moving to our technical infrastructure. We have successfully migrated to the cloud and this has improved our system performance significantly. The response time has decreased by 40%.

For the next quarter, we are planning to expand our team and introduce new products. We believe this will help us capture more market share.

Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?
